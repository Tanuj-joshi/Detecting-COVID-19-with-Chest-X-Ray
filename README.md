# Detecting-COVID-19-with-Chest-X-Ray
In this Project, we created an Image Classifier using a Resnet-18 model and trained it on a Covid-19 Radiography Dataset which is available on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database
This dataset has 3000 images of chest X-Ray scan which are categorized in 3 classes: 
1) Normal
2) Viral Pneumonia
3) Covid-19
Goal is to predict chest X-ray scans that belonged to one of these three classes with a reasonably high accuracy.
