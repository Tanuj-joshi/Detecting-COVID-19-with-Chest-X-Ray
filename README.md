# Detecting-COVID-19-with-Chest-X-Ray
In this Project, we created an Image Classifier using a Resnet-18 model and trained it on a Covid-19 Radiography Dataset which is available on Kaggle. This dataset has 3000 images of chest X-Ray scan which are categorized in 3 classes: Normal, Viral Pneumonia and Covid-19. Goal is to predict chest X-ray scans that belonged to one of these three classes with a reasonably high accuracy.
